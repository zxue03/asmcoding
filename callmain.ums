#  Purpose:    This file contains a function that makes a initial call to main.
#


#  Calling conventions:
#    Return address in r1
#    Stack pointer in r2
#    r6 and r7 are temp registers
#    Nonvolatiles r0, r3, r4
#    r0 is zero

# Purpose: calls the main function, uses r1 to store the return address,
#          then halts the program.
.section init
        .temps r6, r7
        .zero r0
        r0 := 0
        goto main linking r1
        halt
